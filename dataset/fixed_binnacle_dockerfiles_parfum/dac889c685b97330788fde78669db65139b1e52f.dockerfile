#  At this point the image is done and what remains below are the runtime configuration used by the user to configure
#  the container that will be created out of the image. Namely the user can override some environment variables with
#    docker run -e "var1=val1" -e "var2=val2" ...
#  The supported environment variables that can be overridden are:
#  - DB_USER: the name of the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to configure
#             xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
#  - DB_PASSWORD: the password for the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to
#                 configure xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
#  - DB_DATABASE: the name of the database to use. Default is "xwiki". This is used to configure xwiki's
#                 hibernate.cfg.xml file.
#  - DB_HOST: The name of the host (or docker container) containing the database. Default is "db". This is used to
#             configure xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
#  Example:
#    docker run -it -e "DB_USER=xwiki" -e "DB_PASSWORD=xwiki" <imagename>
#  Starts XWiki by starting Tomcat. All options passed to "docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]"
#  are also passed to docker-entrypoint.sh. If "xwiki" is passed then XWiki will be configured the first time the
#  container executes and Tomcat will be started. If some other parameter is passed then it'll be executed to comply
#  with best practices defined at https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#consistency.
