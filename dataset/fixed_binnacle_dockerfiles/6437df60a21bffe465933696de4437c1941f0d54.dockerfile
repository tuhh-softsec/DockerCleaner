#   Docker file for building docker image given the kit bundle. Docker file uses
#   ubtuntu14.04 as base environment.
#
#   Customizable docker properties for build and run time:
#
#   Environment variables used at build times that can be passed in using --build-arg at build time
#   to package specific version of voltdb kit in docker image
#   VOLT_KIT_VERSION  Optional    Specifies the VoltDB kit - kit version suffix of voltdb in
#                                 "voltdb-<kit suffix>.tar.gz".
#                                 For eg. for voltdb-6.6.tar.gz, suffix will be 6.6.
#                                         for voltdb-6.6rc1.tar.gz, suffix will be 6.6rc1.
#                                 If none, provided docker files uses value of is 6.6 which means
#                                 it's expecting file called voltdb-6.6.tar.gz file to package
#                                 voltdb docker image
#   VOLT_DIR_SUFFIX   Optional    Specifies the VoltDB kit directory after extracting the compressed
#                                 bundle file - "voltdb-<kit suffix>". For eg, voltdb-6.6.tar gets
#                                 extracted to voltdb-6.6 directory, so the directoy suffix is 6.6
#
#   Run times customizable behavior using environment variables and mount points. Current docker image
#   is designed to run as executable performing "voltdb init" to initialize the cluster node and "voltdb
#   start" to start initialized database, by exceuting shell script through entrypoint
#
#   Customize behavior for "voltdb init"
#   1 - Deployment file to initialize with: The image gets packaged with default deployment which
#       runs 2 site per host with k-factor of zero. The default deployment can be over-ridden by
#       mounting custom deployment to file /tmp/deployment.xml in container using "-v <custom
#       deployment's absolute path>:/tmp/deployment.xml"
#   2 - Persist data in voltdbroot to host: Mount host location, which will be used as storage for
#       voltdbroot to container path /var/voltdb/ using "-v <host storage location>:/var/voltdb/"
#
#   Customize behavior for "voltdb start"
#   1 - Host count needs to be passed in using HOST_COUNT docker environment through
#       "-e HOST_COUNT=<# of nodes>"
#   2 - Hosts list needs to be passed in using HOSTS docker environment through "-e HOSTS=<Comma
#       separated hostnames or IP address>"
#   3 - License file to use: The license can bespecified by mounting license file to file
#       /tmp/license.xml in container using "-v <license file's absolute path>:/tmp/license.xml"
